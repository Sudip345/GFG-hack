**Install the Dependencies**


**Free API Keys**
Generate Temporary Emails: Use Temp Mail (or your own emails).

Sign Up on AIML API:

Go to https://aimlapi.com/ and sign up.

Navigate to Key Management and create API keys (1 key per email is enough).

Recommended: Create at least 15 API keys to avoid running out of tokens.

Paste the Keys: Copy the API keys and paste them into the script (marked in the code).

**Project Overview**
A simple Python script combining web scraping and AI to automate DSA problem-solving on GeeksforGeeks.

**How It Works**
Input: Provide your GeeksforGeeks username/email and password.

**Automation**: The script:

Logs into your account.

Filters problems (e.g., Unsolved, Solved, Hard, Basic).

Solves problems in your preferred language (default: first available).

Speed: Solves 7â€“8 problems in 2â€“3 minutes.

**Safety Net:**

Limits attempts per problem to 2 (recommended since each API key works 6â€“7 times before tokens exhaust).

Uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model (modifiable, but note: AI can make mistakes).

**Note**
For Fun Only: Do not use this if you genuinely want to learn DSA.

**Error Handling:** Tested to handle common execution errors.

**Final Reminder**
ðŸš€ Enjoy responsibly! This is a experimental projectâ€”run it for fun, not for cheating.
